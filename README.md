This guide will walk you through setting up the **Automated ESG Data Extraction and Performance Analysis** project on your system.
## System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
* **Python Version:** 3.8 or higher
* **Additional Tools:**\
Git (for cloning the repository)\
Virtual environment manager (e.g., venv or virtualenv) recommended.\
Cloud host (with high-performance GPU): Because it takes too long to run the NLP model in `huggingface` and `transformers` locally, our team set up a server to run it using cloud host, so it is recommended to use it.\
Flask-compatible Server: If deploying to production, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn for a production environment.\

## Dependencies
The project relies on various Python libraries for PDF parsing, NLP, and data processing. Key dependencies include:
* `pdfplumber`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `transformers`
* `nltk`
* `docx`
* `PyPDF2`
* `flask`All dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. 

## Installation Steps
### Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:\
`git clone https://github.com/Geekliyi/DSS5105.git`\
`cd app`

### Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run Initial Setup Script
\
Our projects may include a setup script to initialize databases or download additional resources.\
Check the repository for any setup scripts and run them as needed:\
`python setup.py`

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter dependency issues, try updating pip and reinstalling:\
`pip install --upgrade pip`\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
